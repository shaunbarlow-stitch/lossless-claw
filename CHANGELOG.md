# @martian-engineering/lossless-claw

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1145](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1145) [`c6d06e5`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/c6d06e528867004c85ae84897019d94f0cdbea50) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Accept the retired `transcriptGcEnabled` and `autoRotateSessionFiles` settings so upgrades from 0.15 continue to load. Lossless ignores both settings and logs a startup warning that asks operators to remove them.

## 1.0.0

<!-- release-rollback-version: 0.15.6 -->

### Major Changes

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Remove Lossless-owned transcript GC and session-file rotation surfaces for the SQLite-backed OpenClaw runtime. Active transcript storage is now owned by OpenClaw; Lossless no longer exposes `/lossless rotate`, transcript GC config, or automatic session-file rotation config. Existing plugin configs must remove `transcriptGcEnabled` and `autoRotateSessionFiles` before upgrading because OpenClaw's manifest validation rejects removed config keys.

### Patch Changes

- [#1142](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1142) [`e9f8fe4`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/e9f8fe45026b181b4a5c51791135b2fc700f4a3e) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Preserve each message's role in leaf-summary source text rebuilt by `doctor apply`,
  so repaired summaries can distinguish operator input from assistant and tool content.

- [#1070](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1070) [`267f006`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/267f00696fd8266d57dc223ccaa91c20d9f871e6) Thanks [@hannesrudolph](https://github.com/hannesrudolph)! - Persist accepted OpenClaw turns with an atomic idempotency ledger so host retries cannot duplicate or partially advance LosslessClaw context.

- [#1134](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1134) [`aa85938`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/aa859380faa6e68ec55255e5e257db95b3d1c541) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Leave configured threshold headroom when OpenClaw forces overflow recovery, preventing a raw context-window budget from causing no-op compaction.

- [#1108](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1108) [`b3e144b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/b3e144b8683445454f27a6c23ad35c35b8ad3c84) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Inherit OpenClaw's effective default model during context-free durable `commitTurn` summary preparation when no Lossless summary override is configured. Automatic pending-summary work now retains raw context instead of persisting emergency truncations when no model-backed summarizer can be resolved.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Keep CLI conversation diagnostics readable for databases that retain a legacy transcript bootstrap table without newer reconciliation and fork columns.

- [#1052](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1052) [`fa578d0`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/fa578d028c90bee4166603c83f2a7335b721e23e) Thanks [@octo-patch](https://github.com/octo-patch)! - Add MiniMax API-key support to standalone TUI summarization with global and China endpoints and `MiniMax-M3` model inference.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Publish pending summaries for the longest prepared projection prefix, bridge undersized raw islands when later eligible work would otherwise become unreachable, leave undersized trailing suffixes live, refresh deferred pressure after publication, report the active post-publication token count to the host, and avoid double-counting raw backlog as threshold pressure when it is already present in the active projection.

- [#1030](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1030) [`f25e54b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f25e54bca7762c9588a76fd840bdc77e916a658e) Thanks [@cxbAsDev](https://github.com/cxbAsDev)! - Remove duplicate `largeFilesDir` declarations from `openclaw.plugin.json`. The surviving entries describe the default as relative to `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, consistent with the runtime resolver and configuration reference. A regression test now guards against duplicate keys and stale default descriptions.

- [#1057](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1057) [`8f65b00`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/8f65b00b0b0f7dc34b549c36266a974c4e9e2bec) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Preserve completed trailing assistant replies in degraded context assembly when
  OpenClaw supplies the current user prompt separately, while continuing to strip
  blank assistant prefill tails.

- [#1106](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1106) [`fe891a4`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/fe891a41ea8f3482d4664e8666b0bd46dc26aa75) Thanks [@astra-openclaw](https://github.com/astra-openclaw)! - Preserve stable `thread_bootstrap` projection metadata when a managed conversation uses bounded or degraded live fallback, preventing persistent Codex threads from appending the reconstructed transcript again on every turn while compaction maintenance is pending.

- Preserve allowlisted OpenClaw group sender identity through SQLite storage, replay, transcript migration, and leaf-summary source text.

- [#1091](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1091) [`4aa98c6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4aa98c6f81992363a74a1b44a1cefaf5fee8d059) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Preserve new `afterTurn` messages when an unaligned runtime batch only partially overlaps persisted history. Ambiguous mixed batches now ingest in full instead of repeatedly discarding genuine turns beside recurring control rows.

- [#1091](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1091) [`4aa98c6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4aa98c6f81992363a74a1b44a1cefaf5fee8d059) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Preserve distinct tool results when a model reuses tool-call IDs across turns. Only provider-minted IDs now participate in conversation-global event deduplication, and unexpected stable-key collisions retain the row without the conflicting key.

- [#1053](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1053) [`9f5f5f5`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9f5f5f54fc2d1880a3e728ab8533f83e31dee087) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Preserve reasoning replay integrity for DB-assembled assistant messages.

  Ingestion now records the assistant message's model identity
  (`provider`/`api`/`model`/`responseModel`) in ordinal-0 part metadata, and
  assembly re-attaches it so the host's model-bound thinking replay policy can
  recognize same-model history instead of downgrading replayed thinking blocks
  to plain text.

  Assembly applies a three-way `thinkingSignature` gate:

  1. **Sentinel `"reasoning_content"`** — the host's cross-provider reasoning-
     native replay marker, not a provider-issued signature. Preserved only when
     the assembled message carries stored model identity; dropped from legacy
     rows without identity so the host's `transformMessages` doesn't downgrade
     it to response-channel text (the contamination this patch fixes).

  2. **Provider-issued signatures** — kept only when a stored model identity
     survives to the assembled message (the host's `transformMessages` then
     applies its own same-model replay policy). The identity gate is decided at
     message level (identity lives on ordinal-0 metadata, but signature-bearing
     blocks may sit at any ordinal).

  3. **Legacy rows without identity** — keep the historical strip ([#365](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/365)) for
     provider-issued signatures; sentinel blocks are dropped entirely.

  Comparison paths that treat part metadata as message identity
  (`createLosslessMessageSignature`, `externalizedReplayMetadataMatches`) now
  strip model-identity keys before comparing, so rows persisted before the
  upgrade still match their post-upgrade live/assembled representations for
  replay-prefix detection and live-coverage fork-anchor matching.

- [#1111](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1111) [`5185250`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5185250caa6afd64a4ba528576094b41f715ae85) Thanks [@astra-openclaw](https://github.com/astra-openclaw)! - Publish deterministic, raw-linked coverage for pending summary sources that sanitize empty, without retrying or calling the summary model, so later meaningful compaction work can continue and publish without an ordinal gap.

- [#1136](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1136) [`bad9c34`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/bad9c344fab52733612117d39aa72ba1f0da594f) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Remove the unsupported `contracts.sessionActions` manifest field while preserving the runtime `lcm-control` session action.

- [#1089](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1089) [`13c70ec`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/13c70ecfd49109b39fadb889b2e7c072383a6e7b) Thanks [@PollyBot13](https://github.com/PollyBot13)! - Reopen the SQLite-backed context engine when OpenClaw starts a new gateway lifecycle from a cached plugin registry, preventing fallback to the legacy engine after in-process restarts and resolving the current host default model after config changes.

- [#1061](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1061) [`ccad297`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ccad297f076eb29ae42b3a72a38c3a4a6c07bfe6) Thanks [@jjjhenriksen](https://github.com/jjjhenriksen)! - Use OpenClaw's supported `subagent.getSessionMessages()` runtime method when collecting delegated expansion replies, restoring `lcm_expand_query` compatibility with current OpenClaw beta releases.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Give a complete pending-summary frontier a publication-only session-queue opportunity when context crosses the compaction threshold. Publication waits for foreground work already in progress, runs before later queued foreground work, and does not call the summary model. Incomplete frontiers remain deferred for background preparation.

- [#1091](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1091) [`4aa98c6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4aa98c6f81992363a74a1b44a1cefaf5fee8d059) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Separate host-owned prompt framing from Lossless-owned context during threshold compaction. Typed OpenClaw runtime ownership metadata now survives host-parameter projection and follows foreground, maintenance, and deferred compaction paths so uncompactable system, tool, or native-thread history cannot make convergence impossible.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Clamp assembled messages at 90% of the serialized output budget so OpenClaw's final renderer retains headroom for prompt and message-boundary overhead.

- [#1089](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1089) [`13c70ec`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/13c70ecfd49109b39fadb889b2e7c072383a6e7b) Thanks [@PollyBot13](https://github.com/PollyBot13)! - Skip restart and shutdown `session_end` hooks before acquiring the context engine, preventing closed-database errors after `gateway_stop`.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Require OpenClaw 2026.7.2-beta.2 or newer for the branch-safe visible transcript projection used during SQLite session bootstrap, and preserve continuity when that projection uniquely matches a metadata-decorated runtime row.

- [#1044](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1044) [`8ac4720`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/8ac47205d2598c0875b5efde93cb836a15986439) Thanks [@bowenluo718](https://github.com/bowenluo718)! - Fix duplicate ingestion of the same message when the transcript is
  redacted by `logging.redactPatterns` and the live `afterTurn` batch is
  not. Stable assistant response and unambiguous tool-call identities are
  persisted in a new `messages.stable_event_key` column, checked before
  ingest side effects, and protected by a partial unique index. Messages
  without an unambiguous stable identity retain the existing
  content-based and redaction-aware deduplication behavior.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Tighten the structural same-turn supersede so it only collapses a runtime or live copy onto a bare persisted row when the bare body is carried under a channel timestamp, rather than whenever the content merely contains the substring "(untrusted metadata)" or ends with a line equal to the bare body. Structured metadata blocks remain untrusted user-facing text until OpenClaw provides a trusted marker, so metadata-only copies are preserved rather than risk silently superseding an earlier user turn. The guard now covers both the store after-turn path and the assembly supersede path.

- [#1042](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1042) [`4a19e16`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4a19e160d107593ee30e7a2d4c74da7acc2a5d47) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Require transcript provenance before untimestamped metadata-body matches can support covered-frontier replay alignment, while keeping unannounced recaps and heuristic matches fail-closed.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Document the OpenClaw host trust grant required to keep the Lossless `before_prompt_build` recall-policy hook active.

- [#1077](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1077) [`d7d58ce`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d7d58ce8bf78683d947d0582429c8ae51760da44) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Accept the turn-local durable `commitTurn` payload defined by [OpenClaw PR 122149](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/122149), and preserve idempotent retries for beta.1 receipts after the host removes `prePromptMessageCount`.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Verify SQLite transcript anchors before using them for reconciliation, repair safe non-empty legacy anchors, ignore false stale anchors, and add `/lossless doctor anchors` audit counts.

### Patch Changes

- [#1091](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1091) [`4aa98c6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4aa98c6f81992363a74a1b44a1cefaf5fee8d059) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Preserve new `afterTurn` messages when an unaligned runtime batch only partially overlaps persisted history. Ambiguous mixed batches now ingest in full instead of repeatedly discarding genuine turns beside recurring control rows.

- [#1091](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1091) [`4aa98c6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4aa98c6f81992363a74a1b44a1cefaf5fee8d059) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Preserve distinct tool results when a model reuses tool-call IDs across turns. Only provider-minted IDs now participate in conversation-global event deduplication, and unexpected stable-key collisions retain the row without the conflicting key.

- [#1089](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1089) [`13c70ec`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/13c70ecfd49109b39fadb889b2e7c072383a6e7b) Thanks [@PollyBot13](https://github.com/PollyBot13)! - Reopen the SQLite-backed context engine when OpenClaw starts a new gateway lifecycle from a cached plugin registry, preventing fallback to the legacy engine after in-process restarts and resolving the current host default model after config changes.

- [#1091](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1091) [`4aa98c6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4aa98c6f81992363a74a1b44a1cefaf5fee8d059) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Separate host-owned prompt framing from Lossless-owned context during threshold compaction. Typed OpenClaw runtime ownership metadata now survives host-parameter projection and follows foreground, maintenance, and deferred compaction paths so uncompactable system, tool, or native-thread history cannot make convergence impossible.

- [#1089](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1089) [`13c70ec`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/13c70ecfd49109b39fadb889b2e7c072383a6e7b) Thanks [@PollyBot13](https://github.com/PollyBot13)! - Skip restart and shutdown `session_end` hooks before acquiring the context engine, preventing closed-database errors after `gateway_stop`.

### Major Changes

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Remove Lossless-owned transcript GC and session-file rotation surfaces for the SQLite-backed OpenClaw runtime. Active transcript storage is now owned by OpenClaw; Lossless no longer exposes `/lossless rotate`, transcript GC config, or automatic session-file rotation config. Existing plugin configs must remove `transcriptGcEnabled` and `autoRotateSessionFiles` before upgrading because OpenClaw's manifest validation rejects removed config keys.

### Patch Changes

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Keep CLI conversation diagnostics readable for databases that retain a legacy transcript bootstrap table without newer reconciliation and fork columns.

- [#1052](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1052) [`fa578d0`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/fa578d028c90bee4166603c83f2a7335b721e23e) Thanks [@octo-patch](https://github.com/octo-patch)! - Add MiniMax API-key support to standalone TUI summarization with global and China endpoints and `MiniMax-M3` model inference.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Publish pending summaries for the longest prepared projection prefix, bridge undersized raw islands when later eligible work would otherwise become unreachable, leave undersized trailing suffixes live, refresh deferred pressure after publication, report the active post-publication token count to the host, and avoid double-counting raw backlog as threshold pressure when it is already present in the active projection.

- [#1030](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1030) [`f25e54b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f25e54bca7762c9588a76fd840bdc77e916a658e) Thanks [@cxbAsDev](https://github.com/cxbAsDev)! - Remove duplicate `largeFilesDir` declarations from `openclaw.plugin.json`. The surviving entries describe the default as relative to `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, consistent with the runtime resolver and configuration reference. A regression test now guards against duplicate keys and stale default descriptions.

- [#1057](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1057) [`8f65b00`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/8f65b00b0b0f7dc34b549c36266a974c4e9e2bec) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Preserve completed trailing assistant replies in degraded context assembly when
  OpenClaw supplies the current user prompt separately, while continuing to strip
  blank assistant prefill tails.

- [#1053](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1053) [`9f5f5f5`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9f5f5f54fc2d1880a3e728ab8533f83e31dee087) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Preserve reasoning replay integrity for DB-assembled assistant messages.

  Ingestion now records the assistant message's model identity
  (`provider`/`api`/`model`/`responseModel`) in ordinal-0 part metadata, and
  assembly re-attaches it so the host's model-bound thinking replay policy can
  recognize same-model history instead of downgrading replayed thinking blocks
  to plain text.

  Assembly applies a three-way `thinkingSignature` gate:

  1. **Sentinel `"reasoning_content"`** — the host's cross-provider reasoning-
     native replay marker, not a provider-issued signature. Preserved only when
     the assembled message carries stored model identity; dropped from legacy
     rows without identity so the host's `transformMessages` doesn't downgrade
     it to response-channel text (the contamination this patch fixes).

  2. **Provider-issued signatures** — kept only when a stored model identity
     survives to the assembled message (the host's `transformMessages` then
     applies its own same-model replay policy). The identity gate is decided at
     message level (identity lives on ordinal-0 metadata, but signature-bearing
     blocks may sit at any ordinal).

  3. **Legacy rows without identity** — keep the historical strip ([#365](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/365)) for
     provider-issued signatures; sentinel blocks are dropped entirely.

  Comparison paths that treat part metadata as message identity
  (`createLosslessMessageSignature`, `externalizedReplayMetadataMatches`) now
  strip model-identity keys before comparing, so rows persisted before the
  upgrade still match their post-upgrade live/assembled representations for
  replay-prefix detection and live-coverage fork-anchor matching.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Give a complete pending-summary frontier a publication-only session-queue opportunity when context crosses the compaction threshold. Publication waits for foreground work already in progress, runs before later queued foreground work, and does not call the summary model. Incomplete frontiers remain deferred for background preparation.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Clamp assembled messages at 90% of the serialized output budget so OpenClaw's final renderer retains headroom for prompt and message-boundary overhead.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Require OpenClaw 2026.7.2-beta.2 or newer for the branch-safe visible transcript projection used during SQLite session bootstrap, and preserve continuity when that projection uniquely matches a metadata-decorated runtime row.

- [#1044](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1044) [`8ac4720`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/8ac47205d2598c0875b5efde93cb836a15986439) Thanks [@bowenluo718](https://github.com/bowenluo718)! - Fix duplicate ingestion of the same message when the transcript is
  redacted by `logging.redactPatterns` and the live `afterTurn` batch is
  not. Stable assistant response and unambiguous tool-call identities are
  persisted in a new `messages.stable_event_key` column, checked before
  ingest side effects, and protected by a partial unique index. Messages
  without an unambiguous stable identity retain the existing
  content-based and redaction-aware deduplication behavior.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Tighten the structural same-turn supersede so it only collapses a runtime or live copy onto a bare persisted row when the bare body is carried under a channel timestamp, rather than whenever the content merely contains the substring "(untrusted metadata)" or ends with a line equal to the bare body. Structured metadata blocks remain untrusted user-facing text until OpenClaw provides a trusted marker, so metadata-only copies are preserved rather than risk silently superseding an earlier user turn. The guard now covers both the store after-turn path and the assembly supersede path.

- [#1042](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1042) [`4a19e16`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4a19e160d107593ee30e7a2d4c74da7acc2a5d47) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Require transcript provenance before untimestamped metadata-body matches can support covered-frontier replay alignment, while keeping unannounced recaps and heuristic matches fail-closed.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Document the OpenClaw host trust grant required to keep the Lossless `before_prompt_build` recall-policy hook active.

- [#952](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/952) [`d98a7dd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d98a7ddf189e4e62bdf998c9f706cd7108b9fc75) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Verify SQLite transcript anchors before using them for reconciliation, repair safe non-empty legacy anchors, ignore false stale anchors, and add `/lossless doctor anchors` audit counts.

### Patch Changes

- [#1075](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1075) [`8f4f240`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/8f4f240b00139fcefa158b57666442e96c6e2024) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Preserve OpenClaw group sender identity through storage, replay, and leaf summaries.

Added a regression test so the documentation cannot drift from the package metadata again.

- [#1072](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1072) [`f272fab`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f272fab91e49505dcefbd9f19fcc2f7ee070dec8) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Avoid premature threshold compaction by treating raw messages outside the fresh tail as diagnostic and preparation data instead of adding them again to prompt pressure already represented by stored and observed token counts.

  persisted content by correlating the host-minted reset archive and session

SQLite-backed OpenClaw releases require Lossless Claw 1.0.

- [#1030](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1030) [`f25e54b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f25e54bca7762c9588a76fd840bdc77e916a658e) Thanks [@cxbAsDev](https://github.com/cxbAsDev)! - Remove duplicate `largeFilesDir` declarations from `openclaw.plugin.json`. The surviving entries describe the default as relative to `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, consistent with the runtime resolver and configuration reference. A regression test now guards against duplicate keys and stale default descriptions.

Only provider-minted IDs now participate in conversation-global event deduplication, and unexpected stable-key collisions retain the row without the conflicting key.

- [#1053](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1053) [`9f5f5f5`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9f5f5f54fc2d1880a3e728ab8533f83e31dee087) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Preserve reasoning replay integrity for DB-assembled assistant messages.

  Ingestion now records the assistant message's model identity
  (`provider`/`api`/`model`/`responseModel`) in ordinal-0 part metadata, and
  assembly re-attaches it so the host's model-bound thinking replay policy can
  recognize same-model history instead of downgrading replayed thinking blocks
  to plain text.

  Assembly applies a three-way `thinkingSignature` gate:

  1. **Sentinel `"reasoning_content"`** — the host's cross-provider reasoning-
     native replay marker, not a provider-issued signature. Preserved only when
     the assembled message carries stored model identity; dropped from legacy
     rows without identity so the host's `transformMessages` doesn't downgrade
     it to response-channel text (the contamination this patch fixes).

  2. **Provider-issued signatures** — kept only when a stored model identity
     survives to the assembled message (the host's `transformMessages` then
     applies its own same-model replay policy). The identity gate is decided at
     message level (identity lives on ordinal-0 metadata, but signature-bearing
     blocks may sit at any ordinal).

  3. **Legacy rows without identity** — keep the historical strip ([#365](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/365)) for
     provider-issued signatures; sentinel blocks are dropped entirely.

  Comparison paths that treat part metadata as message identity
  (`createLosslessMessageSignature`, `externalizedReplayMetadataMatches`) now
  strip model-identity keys before comparing, so rows persisted before the
  upgrade still match their post-upgrade live/assembled representations for

  redacted by `logging.redactPatterns` and the live `afterTurn` batch is
  not. Stable assistant response and unambiguous tool-call identities are

## 0.15.1

<!-- release-rollback-version: 0.15.0 -->

### Patch Changes

- [#1046](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1046) [`e7b69cf`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/e7b69cf0614f3c567503c084ce7ff5edca8907c1) Thanks [@steipete](https://github.com/steipete)! - Declare the OpenClaw host parameters accepted by the context engine and report the package version in engine metadata.

- [#1002](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1002) [`8ead658`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/8ead658e536e99444586bbf78ceedcc0b6f16acf) Thanks [@mpz4life](https://github.com/mpz4life)! - Skip deferred compaction retry backoff in assemble emergency drain when token pressure exceeds budget. The emergency drain now passes `force: true` to `consumeDeferredCompactionDebt`, bypassing the `nextAttemptAfter` backoff check so compaction can retry immediately instead of waiting for the backoff timer. Normal deferred drain paths (`drainDeferredCompactionDebtIfIdle`, `maintain`) continue to respect backoff. To prevent infinite retries when compaction persistently fails, `force: true` is only applied when `retryAttempts < 3`.

- [#1032](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1032) [`13cd6d3`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/13cd6d374e5014d893ce268886ab952392336be7) Thanks [@ralf003](https://github.com/ralf003)! - Fix an ingest-before-bootstrap race where a conversation with only
  non-anchoring injected metadata rows could not establish a safe transcript
  checkpoint when those rows did not overlap the JSONL transcript.

  Without a checkpoint, every subsequent `afterTurn` reconcile classified the
  conversation as `reason="checkpoint-missing"` with `allowNoAnchorImport=false`,
  imported 0 messages, and skipped all persistence permanently. The conversation
  froze at its pre-bootstrap message count while the JSONL transcript grew
  unbounded.

  The fix reuses the bounded non-anchoring-frontier proof from checkpoint-missing
  recovery. Bootstrap imports the readable transcript before persisting its
  checkpoint, then subsequent `afterTurn` calls resume normally. Conversations
  with real divergent history or unreadable transcripts remain fail-closed so an
  unrelated transcript cannot contaminate stored history.

- [#1007](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1007) [`4a99705`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4a99705a32e24ffd8b00dce2396ba74f1e2ee914) Thanks [@mpz4life](https://github.com/mpz4life)! - Prevent stale deferred-compaction token counts from forcing repeated emergency drains after the stored context has already been compacted.

- [#1020](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1020) [`a4842c2`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/a4842c2319fafd9211b0420773dca45f7fd9117f) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Match `/lossless doctor clean` cron and archived-subagent candidates under every configured OpenClaw agent id. The cleaner now compares exact agent and lane segments so unrelated or malformed session keys remain excluded from scan and apply.

- [#1036](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1036) [`b33d9b7`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/b33d9b7f5810bc4cf4983928dbeaef3cc08c5eaf) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - See through plugin-injected context blocks on decorated channel turns.

  Memory/context plugins prepend blocks like `<relevant-memories>` to the
  model-facing body via `before_prompt_build`, at prompt-build time — strictly
  after the bare transcript row is persisted, so persisted rows never carry
  them. On decorated channels those blocks sit between the inbound metadata
  prelude and the user body, which defeated both the same-turn body collapse and
  the current-turn live-face recognition: the
  memory-bearing live copy was neither collapsed onto its bare persisted row nor
  re-appended after assembly, so the injected context silently vanished from the
  outbound prompt. Anchored covered-frontier alignment now strips validated,
  complete leading injected-context tag blocks (known tag names only), while
  unanchored transcript adoption keeps user-authored tags verbatim. The
  structural current-turn recognizer also accepts a metadata-decorated assembled
  face whose extracted body exactly equals the live copy's extracted body (the
  last assembled user row and recognized-marker gates are unchanged).

  The line-form history recap matcher is now a linear line walker instead of a
  composite backtracking regex. The old pattern went catastrophic (minutes of
  event-loop blocking per call) on entry runs that fail the trailing terminator
  check while containing per-line ambiguity, a shape real group-chat recaps
  produce and which the reduction above newly exposes to routine traffic.
  Semantics are unchanged and pinned by tests, including the all-or-nothing
  fail-closed rejection of an unterminated run.

- [#1018](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1018) [`0068006`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/0068006a74510889d898e1b4c14649e9eb02af78) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Keep OpenClaw's preemptive overflow check enabled when deferred compaction debt forces Lossless Claw to return degraded live context.

- [#1014](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1014) [`9af0795`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9af07952cc874d0d30db157c33c9769c7e937c30) Thanks [@mpz4life](https://github.com/mpz4life)! - Avoid unnecessary after-turn compaction when OpenClaw does not provide a live prompt token count by evaluating the stored context without double-counting its raw prefix.

- [#1011](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1011) [`224c267`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/224c26726a4d9318e1eb00ecbdedcf0e189f7126) Thanks [@mpz4life](https://github.com/mpz4life)! - Skip leaf compaction when selected raw messages are missing or contain no meaningful content, preventing zero-source fallback summaries and context growth. Full sweeps continue past empty-source chunks, clamp tracked token deltas at zero, and stop leaf passes once `stopAtTokens` is reached.

- [#1026](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1026) [`80602dc`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/80602dc28b2ba1a9fbc5c45d7e4122fe9736edcb) Thanks [@ArthurNie](https://github.com/ArthurNie)! - Carry each message's role into the leaf-summary source text.

  `CompactionEngine` dropped `role` when assembling the summarizer input, so a tool
  result quoting another conversation was byte-identical to an operator instruction.
  A summarizer reading that input can promote quoted material to current intent — the
  summary then enters context as user-role text and the model follows it as the active
  task. The header line now reads `[<timestamp> | <role>]`; message bodies are
  unchanged and no schema migration is required.

- [#1000](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1000) [`d3acd24`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d3acd247024c48cf2cad8d33eb248d7f1cffc4ee) Thanks [@ralf003](https://github.com/ralf003)! - Avoid duplicate runtime rows with already-persisted transcript identities when a tracked transcript is temporarily unavailable, while preserving ambiguous rows that the unavailable transcript cannot recover.

- [#1019](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1019) [`2dbf925`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/2dbf92500f6353c66a5f56780e51001a718bee01) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Keep the newest user message and its following assistant/tool suffix together when fresh-tail count or token caps would otherwise split the active turn.

- [#1029](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1029) [`4fd1132`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4fd1132917fc12b3005a057c7e5323a82c385b5e) Thanks [@cxbAsDev](https://github.com/cxbAsDev)! - Correct the documented default for `LCM_LEAF_TARGET_TOKENS` in the README environment-variable table from `1200` to `2400`, matching the runtime default in `src/db/config.ts` and the configuration reference.

- [#1043](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1043) [`d411af0`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d411af02327c32d49dc9309b773b7a4272616214) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Prevent repeated same-body recovery turns from replaying duplicate bare transcript rows by adopting the oldest matching decorated runtime row during transcript reconciliation.

- [#1012](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1012) [`5950a4a`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5950a4ae73c9fe775ad851e41ea7d1c0a32b0f06) Thanks [@mpz4life](https://github.com/mpz4life)! - Respect `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` in all code paths. The `tui`, `stub-tier-live-watcher`, and `stub-tier-assemble-bench` scripts now honor the `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` environment variable instead of hardcoding `~/.openclaw`. A `resolveOpenclawStateDir` helper was extracted for `tui/data.go` matching the existing pattern in `src/db/config.ts`.

- [#1021](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1021) [`5640c28`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5640c28db450054b60aacd78b99a83170c80be58) Thanks [@ArthurNie](https://github.com/ArthurNie)! - Add the `lcm-control` OpenClaw session action so authorized operators can invoke Lossless Claw control operations through the host session-action API.

- [#1041](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/1041) [`f67bb32`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f67bb3232c9d668744b13323f71b7a8d4a22dfaf) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Deferred maintenance drains no longer honour a persisted context-threshold override that current config can no longer produce: the persisted value is kept only while a plausibly-matching override rule still carries the same threshold and recorded sizing, and a persisted global threshold that diverges from the configured global is superseded, so stale rows from removed or reverted threshold experiments cannot wedge compaction.

## 0.15.0

<!-- release-rollback-version: 0.14.0 -->

### Minor Changes

- [#981](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/981) [`189efba`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/189efbaf792cd93ee10579747168ff0f75b2511a) Thanks [@cxbAsDev](https://github.com/cxbAsDev)! - `/lossless doctor apply` can now repair a specific conversation with `doctor apply <conversation-id> confirm-offline`. Targeted repair is limited to authorized OpenClaw command senders and requires the explicit offline confirmation after the target's active channel path is isolated. The existing current-conversation behavior is unchanged when no id is provided.

### Patch Changes

- [#979](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/979) [`dffba95`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/dffba9511a9567e9cf8dc22fae23b06bf983a964) Thanks [@cxbAsDev](https://github.com/cxbAsDev)! - `lcm_describe` now accepts full copied reference strings such as `[LCM Tool Output: file_xxx | ...]` and `[LCM File: file_xxx | ...]` as `id`, extracting the embedded `file_xxx` or `sum_xxx` ID automatically. Bare IDs continue to work; ambiguous input (multiple IDs), zero/empty IDs, and malformed IDs now return clear errors.

- [#935](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/935) [`2b84753`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/2b847535747838c3f2ba29e7a268cfc7f4e7ccf5) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Preserve conversation continuity when never-ingested recovery encounters an exact metadata-decorated runtime copy of a bare transcript row.

- [#991](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/991) [`1b12e4b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/1b12e4beca9e3e23e3405ee5413dd801d398c247) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Fix the ambiguous-rollover identity-scope wedge on rapid same-day /new resets. `messageIdentity` compares role+content only, unscoped by session generation, so a lane whose first post-reset turn happened to repeat trivial content (e.g. a literal "ping" health check) collided with the prior generation's persisted history and the freshness gate froze the lane instead of rotating it, re-warning on every subsequent bootstrap/afterTurn call. Identity overlap on trivial, low-entropy content no longer blocks rotation when the rollover is independently proven deliberate (a durable /new marker plus its archive sibling); substantial overlapping content still fails closed exactly as before, so a foreign session reusing a stale sessionKey is still rejected. A genuine freeze now warns once per session generation instead of on every turn. The once-only memo is capped (FIFO-evicted past 500 distinct generations) so a long-lived host process doesn't accumulate it indefinitely; a generation whose entry is evicted may warn once more on its next occurrence.

- [#996](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/996) [`c4a69c7`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/c4a69c7c7add4bd15da447e9c5264821cd5b11d0) Thanks [@Kaspnov](https://github.com/Kaspnov)! - Add an opt-in `hostFallbackMode: "capture-only"` setting so generic CLI backends can persist turns and use recall tools without Lossless prompt assembly or host-triggered Lossless compaction. Strict full-lifecycle validation remains the default, backend-native compaction remains host-owned, and subagent projection requirements remain unchanged.

- [#830](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/830) [`bc261ec`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/bc261ec2441261d1a7d9199600a8e86a4e7957e0) Thanks [@mpz4life](https://github.com/mpz4life)! - Prevent duplicate tool-call replay ingestion when OpenClaw stores a host-redacted form of sensitive message content.

- [#808](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/808) [`be366bd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/be366bda3c10e4094567a2dccb9bbb9478e6f27b) Thanks [@holgergruenhagen](https://github.com/holgergruenhagen)! - Tolerate and cap oversized CLI summary output instead of failing historical backfill.

- [#939](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/939) [`763ad06`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/763ad06d3ce92331f265a5e0c0adfc6563e1adc4) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Recognize the specific OpenClaw runtime/transcript whitespace divergence, where core collapses runs of spaces in the runtime message to a single space while the transcript persists them verbatim, as one user turn during afterTurn frontier-coverage. This prevents a store double-write of the same turn without collapsing newlines, tabs, or leading and trailing whitespace, so two turns that differ in meaningful whitespace (line breaks or tab indentation) are never merged. Storage stays byte-verbatim; the persisted row is the survivor.

## 0.14.0

<!-- release-rollback-version: 0.13.2 -->

Lossless Claw 0.14.0 adds a packaged diagnostics CLI and combines the
continuity, reconciliation, doctor, recall, and compaction fixes released
since `0.13.2`.

### Highlights

- Inspect conversations, messages, summaries, effective configuration, and
  fresh-tail state through the packaged `lcm` CLI.
- Preserve more live and recovered context across resets, rollovers, replayed
  entries, metadata-wrapped turns, truncated reads, and MCP result envelopes.
- Improve operational safety with scoped-repair backups, version-split
  detection, bounded delegated recall, and quieter healthy-path telemetry.

### Minor Changes

- [#983](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/983) [`367df4e`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/367df4ec10bbaa9065204340d41a33ffdf1fabba) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Add the TypeScript `lcm` executable for paginated read-only conversation diagnostics, message and fresh-tail inspection, depth- and time-filtered summary inspection, effective config viewing, and manifest-validated targeted config edits.

### Patch Changes

- [#958](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/958) [`5442e8e`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5442e8e3f68169530a7543f9a777fe495c63ad4e) Thanks [@mpz4life](https://github.com/mpz4life)! - Fix `doctor-contract` model reference generation to honor the explicit `provider` field in `fallbackProviders` when the model value also contains a slash, preventing false "Missing allowedModels entries" override-policy warnings.

- [#994](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/994) [`669e01d`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/669e01d8b07ae1d82c109b624c8362c99420b7d7) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Bound each delegated recall request by one deadline, cancel timed-out child work through host-owned session cleanup, preserve completed cross-conversation evidence, and return structured failure diagnostics.

- [#947](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/947) [`70805c1`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/70805c1a1e698ba127b31966b64148ad896ea927) Thanks [@ralf003](https://github.com/ralf003)! - Allow isolated cron sessions with a matching durable sessionKey to recover from a checkpoint-missing reconciliation state even when the conversation's sessionId has been overwritten by a newer cron run.

- [#960](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/960) [`6dcc525`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/6dcc525ee15f71d7277a8c77a9f278617c74dfa6) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Demote the per-assemble "appended fork-bounded live suffix" log from warn to debug on the healthy path. Thread-fork sessions append this suffix on essentially every assemble, so the line was warn-level noise in routine operation. The log stays at warn when the append evicted messages or ran over budget, the states that need operator attention. Assembly behavior is unchanged; only the log level moves.

- [#957](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/957) [`2b89cdf`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/2b89cdf635a8b18dd5de58d79ad9a51b3d08e0c9) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Stop the rollover-split doctor from auto-restoring conversations a user deliberately wiped with `/reset`. A new nullable `archive_cause` column records why each conversation was archived, written at the single archive funnel for both the `before_reset` and `session_end` lifecycle events a `/reset` surfaces. The doctor excludes deliberate causes (`manual-reset`) from its merge sources, so a `/reset` archive is never re-merged into the active conversation. Incidental archives (`rollover-fallback`, `cron-rotation`, `session-end`, idle/daily/compaction) and legacy NULL-cause rows stay merge-eligible, so genuine crash and rollover splits are still recovered.

- [#990](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/990) [`b89e192`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/b89e1920643c3c9f4c146b856f940db4f4522928) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Report the active Lossless Claw version and source path in doctor output, and warn when live or generated OpenClaw package copies use a different version.

- [#989](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/989) [`c16c2ef`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/c16c2effbf046b805996a6d2a5ba93b9ecd9bf60) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Prefer the active runtime session when a stale tool session key points scoped `lcm_*` recall at another conversation family.

- [#959](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/959) [`992bf00`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/992bf002f5b6f0a9e037ec43711e1b50d9346795) Thanks [@spiral-cmd](https://github.com/spiral-cmd)! - Delegate ignored-session compaction to OpenClaw's runtime compaction path when the host exposes it, so sessions excluded from LCM can still recover from raw transcript pressure.

- [#993](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/993) [`27cda30`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/27cda302a545b97d5974fa8336c0d8c891437a14) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Preserve real tool results when compacted history displaces them past later tool calls or an earlier synthetic repair result.

- [#972](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/972) [`1a89b30`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/1a89b30a669ae8cf648bc7ad4e67307ea01bf740) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Preserve the conversation on a /new soft reset. The host archives the old transcript by renaming it to `${file}.reset.<ts>` and mints a fresh session id, so the next-turn rollover detector saw a stale session key whose tracked transcript had vanished and destructively archived the pruned conversation, stranding the retained summary band it was documented to carry forward. Lossless now records its own durable /new prune marker, requires that marker plus the reset archive sibling before standing down the destructive guard, keeps foreign reused-key identity-overlap cases at warn, and rebinds once the first turn of the new session lands.

- [#954](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/954) [`0b8e2b2`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/0b8e2b29b99de15bc1541d226adb77ac02f168ff) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Demote the happy-path ambiguous session-key rollover recovery logs from warn to info or debug, context-aware. The successful fresh-transcript rebind and transient not-provably-fresh decisions now log at info; the assemble pass's per-phase preserve restatement logs at debug; the fresh-rebind new-epoch import logs at info, and the afterTurn "frontier not covered" line logs at debug only on the benign ambiguous-rollover path.

  The bootstrap and afterTurn preserve log keys off the freshness disposition carried out of the rebind attempt: a transient or unjudgeable verdict (no usable timestamps, delivery-only traffic, nothing comparable) is a pending state the next turn re-evaluates and logs at debug, while a conflicting verdict (identity overlap, or candidate entries predating persistence) is a genuine freeze and stays at warn. The rebind-failed and freshness-check exception paths, the no-anchor import-cap aborts, and every non-rollover unsafe-to-advance frontier skip also stay at warn. The freeze and no-merge protection is unchanged throughout; only log levels move.

The truncated text is preserved on ingest, bootstrap, and replay paths so transcript fidelity is not compromised by current disk state. Fallback to the truncated fragment when the original path is missing, relative, unreadable, non-regular, or too large for bounded live recovery.

When a memory or context plugin decorates the current turn with injected-context markers (for example `relevant-memories`, `relevant_memories`, `hindsight_memories`, or `active_memory_plugin`) and the channel adds no timestamp, the decorated current turn was previously dropped from live assembly and the model saw only the tag-stripped stored row. It is now re-appended so the decorated current turn is preserved. Because marker presence alone is not provenance proof, marker-based recognition is constrained to the last assembled user row (the current turn's persisted face), so a distinct turn that merely ends with an earlier row's body cannot be matched through a typed marker.

Building on the metadata-block strip landed in [#967](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/967), a decorated inbound turn that also carries a recap of unread channel messages previously kept the recap embedded in its reduced body, so it never matched its bare persisted row and both got replayed to the model (see [#973](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/973)).

  The matcher recognizes the two recap headings OpenClaw core emits ("Chat history since last reply (untrusted, for context):" and "Conversation context (untrusted, chronological, selected for current message):", kept in a single extensible list) across both observed body grammars: the JSON-fenced message array and the older per-message prose line format. It also consumes the exact host JSON context blocks OpenClaw can emit between metadata and recap, such as reply target, thread starter, forwarded-message, and location context. Each combination is validated fail-closed: the strip requires a positive host `history_count`, an exact known heading, and a body that parses under the expected grammar, so user-authored recap-shaped text, a quoted heading, or a malformed payload is left untouched.

  The identity canonicalization also excludes the host's volatile recap count, media count, and truncation fields whenever trusted history is present. On upgrade, the versioned OpenClaw identity repair refreshes message and bootstrap hashes that were already canonicalized before recap removal, preventing stale identity state from re-importing those rows.

Add an optional `fileIds` parameter to restrict the search to specific file IDs. Each match reports the file ID, line number, byte offset, matched text, and a contextual snippet. Update `lcm_describe` to give accurate bounded-search guidance when inlined content is truncated. Honor `allConversations=true` for `scope="files"` by searching large files across all conversations.

## 0.14.0-beta.0

<!-- release-rollback-version: 0.13.2 -->

This beta opens the next Lossless Claw release line for broader testing. It
adds a packaged diagnostics CLI and combines the continuity, reconciliation,
doctor, recall, and compaction fixes merged since `0.13.2`.

### Highlights

- Inspect conversations, messages, summaries, effective configuration, and
  fresh-tail state through the new packaged `lcm` CLI.
- Preserve more live and recovered context across resets, rollovers, replayed
  entries, metadata-wrapped turns, truncated reads, and MCP result envelopes.
- Improve operational safety with scoped-repair backups, version-split
  detection, bounded delegated recall, and quieter healthy-path telemetry.

### Known Boundaries

- This is a prerelease testing build, not a stable-channel promotion.
- Install with `npm install @martian-engineering/lossless-claw@beta`; existing
  stable users remain on npm's `latest` channel.
- Runtime and customer-specific canary results remain separate from package,
  tag, and GitHub Release verification.

### Minor Changes

- [#983](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/983) [`367df4e`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/367df4ec10bbaa9065204340d41a33ffdf1fabba) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Add the TypeScript `lcm` executable for paginated read-only conversation diagnostics, message and fresh-tail inspection, depth- and time-filtered summary inspection, effective config viewing, and manifest-validated targeted config edits.

### Patch Changes

- [#994](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/994) [`669e01d`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/669e01d8b07ae1d82c109b624c8362c99420b7d7) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Bound each delegated recall request by one deadline, cancel timed-out child work through host-owned session cleanup, preserve completed cross-conversation evidence, and return structured failure diagnostics.

- [#947](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/947) [`70805c1`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/70805c1a1e698ba127b31966b64148ad896ea927) Thanks [@ralf003](https://github.com/ralf003)! - Allow isolated cron sessions with a matching durable sessionKey to recover from a checkpoint-missing reconciliation state even when the conversation's sessionId has been overwritten by a newer cron run.

- [#960](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/960) [`6dcc525`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/6dcc525ee15f71d7277a8c77a9f278617c74dfa6) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Demote the per-assemble "appended fork-bounded live suffix" log from warn to debug on the healthy path. Thread-fork sessions append this suffix on essentially every assemble, so the line was warn-level noise in routine operation. The log stays at warn when the append evicted messages or ran over budget, the states that need operator attention. Assembly behavior is unchanged; only the log level moves.

- [#957](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/957) [`2b89cdf`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/2b89cdf635a8b18dd5de58d79ad9a51b3d08e0c9) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Stop the rollover-split doctor from auto-restoring conversations a user deliberately wiped with `/reset`. A new nullable `archive_cause` column records why each conversation was archived, written at the single archive funnel for both the `before_reset` and `session_end` lifecycle events a `/reset` surfaces. The doctor excludes deliberate causes (`manual-reset`) from its merge sources, so a `/reset` archive is never re-merged into the active conversation. Incidental archives (`rollover-fallback`, `cron-rotation`, `session-end`, idle/daily/compaction) and legacy NULL-cause rows stay merge-eligible, so genuine crash and rollover splits are still recovered.

- [#990](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/990) [`b89e192`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/b89e1920643c3c9f4c146b856f940db4f4522928) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Report the active Lossless Claw version and source path in doctor output, and warn when live or generated OpenClaw package copies use a different version.

- [#989](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/989) [`c16c2ef`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/c16c2effbf046b805996a6d2a5ba93b9ecd9bf60) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Prefer the active runtime session when a stale tool session key points scoped `lcm_*` recall at another conversation family.

- [#959](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/959) [`992bf00`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/992bf002f5b6f0a9e037ec43711e1b50d9346795) Thanks [@spiral-cmd](https://github.com/spiral-cmd)! - Delegate ignored-session compaction to OpenClaw's runtime compaction path when the host exposes it, so sessions excluded from LCM can still recover from raw transcript pressure.

- [#993](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/993) [`27cda30`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/27cda302a545b97d5974fa8336c0d8c891437a14) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Preserve real tool results when compacted history displaces them past later tool calls or an earlier synthetic repair result.

- [#972](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/972) [`1a89b30`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/1a89b30a669ae8cf648bc7ad4e67307ea01bf740) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Preserve the conversation on a /new soft reset. The host archives the old transcript by renaming it to `${file}.reset.<ts>` and mints a fresh session id, so the next-turn rollover detector saw a stale session key whose tracked transcript had vanished and destructively archived the pruned conversation, stranding the retained summary band it was documented to carry forward. Lossless now records its own durable /new prune marker, requires that marker plus the reset archive sibling before standing down the destructive guard, keeps foreign reused-key identity-overlap cases at warn, and rebinds once the first turn of the new session lands.

- [#954](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/954) [`0b8e2b2`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/0b8e2b29b99de15bc1541d226adb77ac02f168ff) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Demote the happy-path ambiguous session-key rollover recovery logs from warn to info or debug, context-aware. The successful fresh-transcript rebind and transient not-provably-fresh decisions now log at info; the assemble pass's per-phase preserve restatement logs at debug; the fresh-rebind new-epoch import logs at info, and the afterTurn "frontier not covered" line logs at debug only on the benign ambiguous-rollover path.

  The bootstrap and afterTurn preserve log keys off the freshness disposition carried out of the rebind attempt: a transient or unjudgeable verdict (no usable timestamps, delivery-only traffic, nothing comparable) is a pending state the next turn re-evaluates and logs at debug, while a conflicting verdict (identity overlap, or candidate entries predating persistence) is a genuine freeze and stays at warn. The rebind-failed and freshness-check exception paths, the no-anchor import-cap aborts, and every non-rollover unsafe-to-advance frontier skip also stay at warn. The freeze and no-merge protection is unchanged throughout; only log levels move.

The truncated text is preserved on ingest, bootstrap, and replay paths so transcript fidelity is not compromised by current disk state. Fallback to the truncated fragment when the original path is missing, relative, unreadable, non-regular, or too large for bounded live recovery.

- [#978](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/978) [`013de1f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/013de1f1b0592eb97139c9387790daafdcb2653c) Thanks [@gorkem2020](https://github.com/gorkem2020)! - Recognize memory-first current turns in live coverage. When a memory or context plugin decorates the current turn with injected-context markers (for example `relevant-memories`, `relevant_memories`, `hindsight_memories`, or `active_memory_plugin`) and the channel adds no timestamp, the decorated current turn was previously dropped from live assembly and the model saw only the tag-stripped stored row. It is now re-appended so the decorated current turn is preserved. Because marker presence alone is not provenance proof, marker-based recognition is constrained to the last assembled user row (the current turn's persisted face), so a distinct turn that merely ends with an earlier row's body cannot be matched through a typed marker.

Degraded after-turn dedup remains timestamp-gated, so repeated short user messages wrapped in forgeable metadata-shaped text are preserved instead of silently collapsed.

Building on the metadata-block strip landed in [#967](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/967), a decorated inbound turn that also carries a recap of unread channel messages previously kept the recap embedded in its reduced body, so it never matched its bare persisted row and both got replayed to the model (see [#973](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/973)).

  The matcher recognizes the two recap headings OpenClaw core emits ("Chat history since last reply (untrusted, for context):" and "Conversation context (untrusted, chronological, selected for current message):", kept in a single extensible list) across both observed body grammars: the JSON-fenced message array and the older per-message prose line format. It also consumes the exact host JSON context blocks OpenClaw can emit between metadata and recap, such as reply target, thread starter, forwarded-message, and location context.

### Patch Changes

- [#855](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/855) [`0681006`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/06810069254aa35d2f013c3ebb02fadc90d0db12) Thanks [@bowenluo718](https://github.com/bowenluo718)! - Prevent `afterTurn` replay batches from duplicating messages whose stored content was rewritten during ingest, such as large-file payload references.

OpenClaw writes two JSONL entries per assistant turn — the model response (with reasoning + text) and a delivery-mirror (text only, `model="delivery-mirror"`). Both share the same `identity_hash` because `toStoredMessage` strips reasoning, but they have different transcript entry ids, so the entry-id idempotency check does not catch the mirror. This skips delivery-mirror ingestion only when the immediately previous assistant message has the same identity and preserved reasoning content, including top-level `reasoning_content` metadata.

Defaults to `true` (preserves current behavior). Set to `false` to disable reasoning and keep summarization output concise when reasoning is not needed for faithful summaries.

Transcript imports are now idempotent by construction (`messages.transcript_entry_id` with a partial unique index), the afterTurn runtime batch is reconciled by exact alignment against the covered transcript frontier instead of heuristic dedup, rewritten/rotated transcripts are recognized as declared epoch rollovers via the session header id instead of path/size heuristics, and flush-lagged runtime rows are healed in place by adopting the catch-up entry's id rather than duplicated. Entry-id anchoring also survives post-ingest content rewriting (externalized tool results), which previously could freeze conversations. The content-identity machinery remains as the fallback for transcripts without envelope ids. Design: specs/transcript-reconciliation-by-entry-id.md.

### Patch Changes

- [#885](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/885) [`9f36aa3`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9f36aa300c58bada5e45e7da419b77815b688b12) Thanks [@rafaelreis-r](https://github.com/rafaelreis-r)! - Fix a `[#822](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/822)` `afterTurn` deadlock where a conversation with an all-zero placeholder `conversation_bootstrap_state` row and a persisted frontier of only non-anchoring rows (e.g. one or more injected `Conversation info (untrusted metadata)` preambles) never re-imported its on-disk transcript. The placeholder-checkpoint-recovery reconcile ran without `allowNoAnchorImport`, so it imported 0 messages and never advanced the checkpoint; every turn then emitted the `did not cover the transcript frontier` warning, `assemble()` fell back to the raw transcript, and compaction never ran for that conversation.

  The placeholder recovery now opens a no-anchor import, but only when the persisted frontier is proven to hold no real conversation content — generalizing [#837](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/837)'s single-injected-metadata-preamble check to a frontier composed entirely of non-anchoring injected-metadata rows (any count, via a bounded scan). A frontier with real anchoring rows conservatively freezes per [#649](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/649)'s no-proof-no-advance guard, so an unrelated/rotated transcript can never be stitched onto real history (the failure mode that closed [#824](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/824)). For the proven-safe case the no-anchor import cap is lifted so a transcript larger than the cap recovers fully, bounded by the transcript length rather than left unbounded. The downstream import remains guarded by replay-overlap detection, the delivery-only block (now also applied to this lane), and the cross-conversation raw-id guard.

  The same generalized non-anchoring-frontier gate now also drives the afterTurn checkpoint-missing lane ([#837](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/837)), which previously required exactly one persisted frontier row: a conversation that accumulated several injected-metadata preambles before losing its checkpoint recovers there too, and the cap lift applies under the same proof.

- [#838](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/838) [`e9697e4`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/e9697e4f0a5b42af1838d0e1d7e334306c59c8a7) Thanks [@holgergruenhagen](https://github.com/holgergruenhagen)! - Fix an `afterTurn` deadlock where a conversation with `bootstrapped_at` set but no `conversation_bootstrap_state` row (`reason="checkpoint-missing"`) and a non-anchoring DB frontier (e.g. a single injected `Conversation info (untrusted metadata)` preamble) imported 0 messages and never persisted a checkpoint. Such conversations emitted the `found no anchor and imported 0 messages` / `did not cover the transcript frontier` warning pair on every turn forever, with compaction permanently disabled until the row was archived by hand.

  The recovery path (`allowNoAnchorImportOnCheckpointMissing`) previously ran only on the rotate lane. The `afterTurn` lane now also recovers a `checkpoint-missing` no-anchor frontier, but only for already-bootstrapped conversations (`bootstrapped_at` set) — a never-bootstrapped conversation with a divergent rewritten transcript still freezes per [#649](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/649)'s no-proof-no-advance guard. The downstream no-anchor import remains guarded by replay-overlap detection, the import cap, and the delivery-only block.

  Fixes [#837](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/837).

- [#886](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/886) [`e6568d7`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/e6568d77019bff58992d84c3848436fbb83d6119) Thanks [@rafaelreis-r](https://github.com/rafaelreis-r)! - `afterTurn` now fails closed when the transcript reconcile throws. The catch handler previously left the initialized in-sync default (`hasOverlap: true`) in place, so a thrown reconcile persisted the live batch AND refreshed the checkpoint to EOF — silently advancing past transcript history that was never reconciled into the DB. The catch now reports the turn as not covered, skipping batch persistence and checkpoint refresh for that turn; nothing is lost because the transcript retains the turn and the next successful reconcile imports it.

- [#864](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/864) [`68ed199`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/68ed19954129e2178895415ca8318dc78fa5f05c) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Resolve ambiguous session-key runtime rollovers when the new transcript is provably fresh.

  When a runtime session rolls to a new sessionId while the key's conversation
  still tracks an existing transcript file, the ambiguity guard froze the lane
  entirely: no adoption, no rotation, no persistence — indefinitely. On a live
  instance two agent main lanes ran frozen for a week, silently recording
  nothing while their transcripts grew.

  bootstrap and afterTurn now attempt a tier-2 resolution using full-transcript
  evidence: when the rolled transcript is provably fresh — every entry carries
  a usable timestamp (message or envelope) postdating the conversation's last
  persisted message, and no entry's identity overlaps the conversation's recent
  persisted history — the rollover is a legitimate reset, so the old
  conversation is archived (fully preserved and queryable) and the new session
  binds and bootstraps normally. Freshness is judged on content+time evidence,
  never transcript size, so lanes that ran frozen for days self-heal on their
  first turn after upgrade. Anything short of proof (overlap, stale or missing
  timestamps, no comparable persisted content) stays frozen exactly as before,
  and a rotation that lands as a lifecycle no-op is reported honestly instead
  of claiming the lane healed. assemble deliberately does NOT rotate: it only
  sees the host's live window, which is not transcript evidence.

  Telemetry: "ambiguous rollover resolved by fresh-transcript rotation",
  "ambiguous rollover not provably fresh (freshness=...)", and "rotation had
  no effect" warn lines.

- [#860](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/860) [`94f3431`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/94f3431b31ba63de2b8cd71fcc244d75fe9c121e) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Unfreeze anchored transcript reconcile when the backlog exceeds the import cap.

  A session whose transcript grew past the reconcile import cap (e.g. heavy
  old-harness history) froze permanently: every pass logged "import cap
  exceeded ... Aborting to prevent flood", imported nothing, and afterTurn
  skipped persistence to avoid advancing the frontier — while the backlog kept
  growing faster than the cap ever could. The live incident left a main-topic
  conversation with 1,700+ unpersisted messages and silent data loss on every
  turn.

  When the missing tail is anchored (lineage proven by an identity anchor in
  this conversation), reconcile now imports a bounded oldest-first chunk per
  pass instead of aborting: order is preserved, per-pass flood exposure stays
  capped, the growing message count raises the cap, and repeated passes
  converge until the backlog drains. The checkpoint/frontier still does not
  advance while a pass is capped. No-anchor caps (unproven lineage, e.g.
  path-mismatched epochs) still block entirely. Telemetry: the warn line is now
  "import cap chunking ... importing N/M anchored backlog messages this pass".

  Extended after the entry-id reconciliation rework ([#854](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/854)): the same chunked
  drain now applies to the entry-id anchored path — which carries 100% of
  current-format traffic and had the same permanent-freeze shape — and to
  fully id-bearing no-anchor epochs (declared rollovers), where every entry
  adopts or imports by verified id, so a kept tail beyond the cap drains in
  bounded passes instead of freezing before stale-id adoption can heal it.
  After the first chunk persists ids, the entry-id anchor takes over on
  subsequent passes. Id-less no-anchor batches still block entirely.

External user input keeps the aggregate role/timestamp replay budget, while internal runtime output is budgeted by exact message identity. The threshold is split into two configurable options:

  - `replayFloodThresholdExternal` (default `3`, env `LCM_REPLAY_FLOOD_THRESHOLD_EXTERNAL`) — applies to replay-like `role=user` rows, preserving legacy replay defense for third-partyly-rebroadcastable input.
  - `replayFloodThresholdInternal` (default `32`, env `LCM_REPLAY_FLOOD_THRESHOLD_INTERNAL`) — applies to `role=tool/assistant/system`, absorbing legitimate same-second idempotent runtime output while still bounding pathological loops.

  Fixes a class of false-positives that cascaded into `skipping compaction` / reconcile failures on cron and sub-agent workloads. Related to [#639](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/639).

- [#857](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/857) [`36100ce`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/36100ce11e9c9a86bfca626174ef38dea82e555f) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Bound assemble() output by serialized model-boundary token estimate.

  Live messages that carry structured tool payloads (e.g. transcripts imported
  from a previous harness) were estimated by text blocks only, undercounting the
  real prompt by 2-3x. assemble() could return a context the host's LLM-boundary
  estimator rejected as far over budget, wedging the session in a
  compact/overflow loop while every internal pressure check stayed green.

  Token estimates for live messages now serialize the full message structure
  (with a fixed per-part substitution for embedded binary payloads), live
  fallback paths return budget-bounded suffixes instead of the unbounded
  transcript, and a final serialized-estimate clamp guarantees assembled output
  never exceeds the token budget. Assemble telemetry now logs the serialized
  estimate, the internal estimate, and clamp activity (`serializedClamped=`,
  `[lcm] assemble: serialized budget clamp`, `[lcm] assemble: bounded live
fallback`) for live monitoring.

  A tool loop that re-issues a byte-identical tool call every iteration made
  the append-only import guard declare each appended pair "already persisted"
  (content identity matched the previous iteration), forcing a full transcript
  re-read per tool call while the covered-frontier alignment refused every
  runtime batch — reconcile churned on every iteration of the loop while the
  model's context stopped advancing (live incident lossless-claw-3071).

  The guard now reasons in transcript entry ids: a fresh entry id is a new
  entry regardless of content. Full reconciliation is still required for the
  three cases that genuinely need it — an already-persisted entry id (replay),
  a fresh id whose content matches an unstamped persisted row (flush-lag
  catch-up that must adopt, not duplicate), and an entry reparenting onto a
  non-tip persisted entry (host suffix rewrite needing stale-id re-stamping).
  Parents unknown to the DB (pruned rows, replay-filtered entries) are treated
  as genuine continuation since the append-only checkpoint already verified
  the file prefix.

  When a threshold sweep takes no action and does not fail (no eligible leaf/condensed candidates remain) while the conversation is still over target, compaction can never make progress — it shrinks STORED leaves but cannot reduce the host's OBSERVED live tokens. Previously this returned `ok=false`/`reason="live context still exceeds target"`, so the deferred-debt drain kept the maintenance row `pending=1`, climbed `retry_attempts`, opened summary-spend backoff, and thrashed the assemble degraded-fallback every turn.

  `executeCompactionCore` now flags this terminal state as `exhausted` (while still returning `ok=false` so overflow recovery and [#15](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/15) keep the honest still-over-target signal), and `consumeDeferredCompactionDebt` treats an exhausted result as a completed no-op: it clears the debt (`keepPending=false`, no failure summary) instead of retrying forever. Emergency assemble drains still return bounded degraded live context for the current over-budget turn when exhaustion is discovered inline. Adds deterministic regressions that reproduce the wedge (matches the production `conversation_compaction_maintenance.last_failure_summary="live context still exceeds target"`).

  Addresses the deferred-compaction-loop half of [#639](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/639) (the residual that [#621](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/621)/[#681](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/681) did not cover). Based on @Grynn's exhaustion-handling proposal in the [#639](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/639) thread.

[#503](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/503) sanitized summarizer **input** at `CompactionEngine.leafPass`; this PR closes the two remaining gaps that were in scope:

  - **Output side**: when the summary provider response would persist a reasoning-shaped payload (text wrapped in `<think>…</think>` / `<thinking>…</thinking>` / `<reasoning>…</reasoning>`, or opened with a `[thinking]` / `[reasoning]` label) as the summary body, log and treat the summary as empty so the existing envelope → retry → deterministic-fallback chain runs instead of silently storing reasoning text. Mitigates the silent-persist failure mode reported by [#471](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/471) (vLLM+Qwen3) and [#542](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/542) (Kimi K2.6).
  - **Non-leaf passes**: `extractMeaningfulMessageText` is now applied at every summarizer entry point — `leafPass` (already covered by [#503](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/503)), the condensed/merge pass that re-summarizes leaf summaries, and the prior-summary-context resolver. Summaries built from already-sanitized leaves can no longer reintroduce raw thinking/reasoning blocks at higher levels, including from legacy data persisted before [#503](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/503).

  Doctor remediation for legacy assistant rows that contain only thinking blocks (sub-fix F8 from the issue) is deferred — the existing doctor cleaner architecture operates on conversation-level deletion, not message-row remediation, and adding a backup-table pattern would significantly expand the surface area of this PR. Tracked separately.

  The tier-2 rollover resolution false-blocked on the very lane it was built
  for: a week-idle conversation whose entire recent history was synthetic
  heartbeat traffic. Every session's transcript contains identical
  "[OpenClaw heartbeat poll]" / "HEARTBEAT_OK" lines, so the identity-overlap
  test matched 46 heartbeat rows and reported plausible lineage where there
  was none.

  The overlap comparison now considers only lineage-discriminating content:
  synthetic heartbeat traffic and content that recurs within the window are
  excluded from both sides, and the window widens (50 -> 500) when the recent
  history yields nothing comparable. When even the widened window is pure
  template noise, the overlap test is acknowledged as no-signal and the
  strict per-entry time gate decides alone — every new entry must still
  postdate the conversation's last persisted message. Real unique-content
  overlap still freezes the lane exactly as before.

  A threshold sweep that hit its per-sweep wall-clock deadline while still
  reducing tokens recorded "compacted but still over target" and opened a
  30-minute spend backoff, which then blocked emergency drains and silently
  no-opped user-initiated /compact. Recovery that was working was treated the
  same as recovery that could never work.

  Threshold sweeps now chain within the operation-wide deadline
  (`compactUntilUnderDeadlineMs`, capped by `maxSweepIterations`) instead of
  failing after one bounded sweep; the spend backoff only opens when a round
  makes no further progress; and manual compaction clears an open backoff
  (an explicit repair request is informed consent to spend). Telemetry: the
  compact done line gains `chainedSweeps=`/`spendBackoffOpened=`, plus
  "spend backoff skipped" and "manual request cleared summary spend backoff"
  lines for live monitoring.

  When a threshold sweep finds no eligible candidates while host-observed
  pressure keeps the session over target, the host is rebuilding prompts from
  live transcript state the engine cannot shrink — retrying stored compaction
  can never converge. This terminal state previously reported the generic
  "live context still exceeds target", which hosts answer with misleading
  reserve-tuning advice. compact() now returns "stored compaction exhausted but
  live context still exceeds target; transcript reset required" (alongside the
  existing exhausted flag that clears deferred debt). The verdict requires an
  explicit host-observed token count and never fires on budget-stopped sweeps,
  so estimator gaps or interrupted sweeps cannot condemn recoverable sessions.
  Telemetry: a "[lcm] compact: transcript wedge detected" warn line with
  stored/observed/overhead counts.

  Memory and context plugins (`active-memory`, `memory-lancedb`, `hindsight-openclaw`, etc.) prepend XML-tagged blocks to user messages via the `prependContext` hook. Without stripping, the compaction summarizer treats these ephemeral retrieval blocks as real conversation content, permanently corrupting summaries.

  New `stripInjectedContextTags` config option (string array, defaults to well-known plugin tags). Override via plugin config or `LCM_STRIP_INJECTED_CONTEXT_TAGS` env var. Set to `[]` to disable.

  Pending deferred compaction debt is now left for the after-turn background drain
  or host-approved maintenance while the live prompt is still within the active
  token budget. `assemble()` only drains pending debt synchronously as an
  emergency safeguard when the live prompt estimate is already over budget,
  without turning ordinary threshold debt into foreground latency.

  Injected directives embedded in conversation history could survive compaction and be
  replayed in later turns. This change defends the content layer end to end:

  - The summarizer system prompt no longer instructs the model to "follow user
    instructions exactly"; it now treats all conversation text as untrusted data and
    must strip embedded directives, role reassignments, and behavioral overrides.
  - Every leaf/condensed summarization prompt (D1/D2/D3+) marks its input as
    UNTRUSTED DATA so the summarizer extracts facts without obeying embedded
    instructions.
  - Assembled summaries carry a `trust="untrusted"` taint label on the `<summary>`
    tag, and the runtime recall system prompt tells the model not to follow any
    instructions found within summary content.

  Summaries are still reinserted with the `user` role. Downgrading the role
  (issue [#71](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/71) recommendation 1) requires OpenClaw upstream support — `toolResult`
  is dropped by tool-result pairing sanitation and `assistant` risks provider
  first-message/alternation constraints — and is tracked as follow-up.

The leaf/condensed pass loop now stops at a hard iteration cap (`maxSweepIterations`, default 12) and a wall-clock deadline (`sweepDeadlineMs`, default 120000), returning the consistent partial result instead of running unbounded passes. The sweep also yields the Node event loop between its synchronous `node:sqlite` scans so a long sweep cannot freeze the gateway for its whole duration. Both limits are configurable via plugin config or `LCM_MAX_SWEEP_ITERATIONS` / `LCM_SWEEP_DEADLINE_MS`.

  Also bound the whole `compactUntilUnder` overflow-recovery operation. It runs up to `maxRounds` sweeps, and each sweep re-arms its own `sweepDeadlineMs`, so without an operation-wide budget the worst case was `maxRounds × sweepDeadlineMs` (~20 minutes at the defaults). `compactUntilUnder` now computes one wall-clock deadline (`compactUntilUnderDeadlineMs`, default 300000), shares it into every round's sweep so a sweep stops at whichever deadline is sooner, and checks it before starting the next round — returning the consistent partial result on expiry.

### Minor Changes

- [#692](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/692) [`a13905a`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/a13905a832bfe843de472cb408222bed1b5f8ca7) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Add focus brief generation through `/lossless focus <prompt>`, active focus overlays, unfocus/refocus lifecycle handling, and TUI/status diagnostics for generated briefs.

### Patch Changes

- [#688](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/688) [`d1bef05`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d1bef053326bd65e2736889ef4fa916f6e8bf1ec) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Preserve unpersisted OpenClaw inter-session live input when assembling context from LCM's durable DB frontier.

- [#685](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/685) [`a6640b6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/a6640b648fc87d895b94ee277a9218a1f4a735a8) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Seed a placeholder `conversation_bootstrap_state` row in the afterTurn slow-path stat-fail branch so the next turn can recover.

  `[#649](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/649)` added a stat-fail fallback that returns `hasOverlap:true` to permit live `afterTurn` persistence even when `stat(sessionFile)` fails, expecting the subsequent `refreshAfterTurnBootstrapState` hook to refresh the checkpoint. That hook calls `refreshBootstrapState`, which independently calls `stat(sessionFile)` and throws on failure, so the catch block in the hook swallows the error and `conversation_bootstrap_state` stays `NULL`. Every subsequent `afterTurn` then re-enters the slow path with `reason="checkpoint-missing"`, which is intentionally excluded from `allowNoAnchorImport`, and the conversation gets stuck: LCM degrades into a transparent passthrough where the assemble safe-fallback returns `params.messages` verbatim and compaction never runs.

  This restores the contract that "permissive return ⟹ checkpoint exists" without re-introducing the unconditional refresh `[#649](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/649)` deliberately removed. The placeholder is written via `summaryStore.upsertConversationBootstrapState` directly so it does not depend on stat success. Subsequent turns recover from offset=0 once the transcript becomes statable, but route that placeholder recovery through the existing DB-anchor reconciliation path so already-persisted live afterTurn messages are not replayed as new rows.

- [#696](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/696) [`1869c6c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/1869c6c574e02e54ae1d69f94263e374de06234b) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Mark OpenClaw as an optional peer dependency so standalone plugin installs do not pull a second OpenClaw runtime tree.

- [#573](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/573) [`5621e8f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5621e8f2f37c0f5f9ee68e2334d6ab43d3887a06) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Generalize the native-image-block externalizer to assistant, system, tool, and toolResult messages. PR [#521](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/521) in v0.9.3 only ran on user-role messages, so:

  - Assistant or system messages carrying native `{type:"image", data:...}` blocks fell through to the generic raw-payload externalizer and were stored as `raw-{role}-payload.json` blobs with embedded base64 instead of dedupe-friendly image files.
  - Tool and toolResult messages (which skip raw-payload externalization entirely) had their image blocks persisted inline through the standard `message_parts` pipeline, embedding base64 directly in the DB row.

  In both cases the result was the same: no large*file row, no `lcm_describe` rendering, and no inter-conversation dedupe. The interceptor now runs for every persistable role, replacing native image blocks with `[<Role> image: ... | LCM file: file*…]` references and storing the image file once.

  `interceptLargeRawPayload` also no longer skips externalization based on a content substring match (`isExternalizedReferenceContent`); it now only skips when the message already carries the explicit `rawPayloadExternalized: true` flag, so a still-oversized message that merely embeds an image reference alongside other content is still externalized.

  Extension map: added `image/heic`, `image/avif`, and `image/bmp` so MIME-detection misses for those formats produce a sensible filename.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#338](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/338) [`a05b9e4`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/a05b9e4c83a21c22e9279f66e848e84eed389fe8) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Search and expansion tools now treat rotated conversation segments that share a stable session identity as one recall scope by default.

### Patch Changes

- [#631](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/631) [`b6568da`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/b6568daa91cea86c043ba6da34623f4b564f09ee) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Disable SQLite backups during automatic session-file rotation by default. Set `autoRotateSessionFiles.createBackups` to `true` to keep automatic runtime and startup rotation creating the rolling `rotate-latest` backup; manual `/lcm rotate` still creates that backup by default.

- [#640](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/640) [`85ba63d`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/85ba63d2d70d9e4fb74d1f304a94bc36063d544d) Thanks [@0xopaque](https://github.com/0xopaque)! - Prevent existing-conversation bootstrap from replaying prior transcript rows as fresh LCM messages. Bootstrap append/reconcile now filters replay-shaped tails, message writes reject same-timestamp prior-content floods, and ingest batches run transactionally.

- [#661](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/661) [`4f78d92`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4f78d9226a188c6fef1f03b06c03d525fac446bf) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Preserve hot prompt-cache deferral for direct OpenAI GPT models and raise the default critical budget pressure ratio to 0.90 so normal threshold compaction does not immediately bypass cache protection.

- [#622](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/622) [`36c47d1`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/36c47d1dbfd98258912e0bc883be703afc024ca6) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Treat existing `cold-cache-catchup` compaction debt as legacy threshold work. Background, assemble, and host-approved maintain drains now revalidate old non-threshold debt against `contextThreshold`, run a threshold full sweep when still needed, or clear the debt when the conversation is already under threshold.

- [#621](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/621) [`a81bb34`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/a81bb34b869b4b3d1e0d52d248a499be7d45c3e5) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Fix `afterTurn` skipping compaction evaluation when `ingestBatch` is empty. When `deduplicateAfterTurnBatch` removed every new message (e.g. because `afterTurnTranscriptReconcile` or per-message `engine.ingest` calls had already imported them), `afterTurn` would early-return before reaching the compaction policy block. Long-running conversations could accumulate well beyond `contextThreshold` without ever triggering threshold compaction, deferred-compaction debt, or budget-trigger recovery — leaving the host's emergency overflow truncation as the only safety net. The early-return is now replaced with a fall-through: when `ingestBatch` is empty the actual `ingestBatch` call is skipped, but token-budget resolution, conversation lookup, and the existing compaction evaluation flow still run. This is observable in the `[lcm] afterTurn: nothing to ingest …` log line, which now ends with `(continuing to compaction evaluation; transcript reconcile may have already ingested)`.

- [#691](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/691) [`9737eac`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9737eac67c2663031af0e9c78a78955cd7de6db0) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Advertise context-engine thread bootstrap projection epochs from DB-backed assembly so hosts can avoid reinjecting Lossless context every turn.

- [#606](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/606) [`0cdb664`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/0cdb664920e456b564ee081d7e60b2d8d0cd5644) Thanks [@castaples](https://github.com/castaples)! - Fix Bedrock `messages.0 is empty` validation rejection by extending the assemble pass's empty-content filter to cover `user` and `toolResult` roles, not only `assistant`. Previously an empty content array briefly produced upstream could survive the cleaned-tail filter and be sent to Bedrock Converse, which rejects it with `The content field in the Message object at messages.N is empty. Add a ContentBlock object to the content field and try again.` The new unified `isEmptyMessageContent` helper drops empty-array, empty-string, null, and undefined content for any role while preserving the existing assistant-only thinking-only / blank-text guards.

- [#691](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/691) [`9737eac`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9737eac67c2663031af0e9c78a78955cd7de6db0) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Run threshold full-sweep leaf compaction until eligible raw history is exhausted, and only trigger condensation from summarized-prefix pressure.

- [#634](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/634) [`8ad543b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/8ad543be90bc10211d8e4dacb3a60d81d7286fa2) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Keep lcm_describe tool result details compact so OpenClaw post-processing middleware accepts large summary descriptions.

- [#670](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/670) [`7f3285c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/7f3285c642faecb5e90680a7f567439cda52f0d5) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Reject obvious regex syntax in `lcm_grep` full-text mode with a helpful error and clarify regex-vs-FTS routing guidance.

- [#637](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/637) [`6303ec2`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/6303ec23a4a42dc22167f5d26fe47a64a98029dd) Thanks [@NePav](https://github.com/NePav)! - Move the PI runtime packages to the new `@earendil-works/*` scope and install `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`, `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, and `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` as runtime `dependencies`. The plugin's bundled `dist/index.js` imports these unconditionally (build externalizes the PI scope), so absence becomes a hard `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` at module load. Treating them as runtime dependencies makes the plugin self-contained on `npm install` and removes the host-symlink workaround currently required on fresh OpenClaw installs.

  Fixes [#636](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/636).

- [#633](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/633) [`e665a0e`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/e665a0effd2419ab75a0156b8d8f65e9c3f72046) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Register explicit plugin tool runtime names so cached tool descriptors can execute every lcm\_\* tool on newer OpenClaw releases.

- [#689](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/689) [`5bd5292`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5bd5292740a06eb102faacbe5ab883ed835ab3e6) Thanks [@abnershang](https://github.com/abnershang)! - Use OpenClaw's current runtime config snapshot API to avoid the deprecated plugin `config.loadConfig()` warning on newer hosts.

- [#600](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/600) [`fcd013a`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/fcd013a9d44eac3a1451a7fd2858e8982f0f7629) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Add OpenClaw runtime LLM policy migration support for configured Lossless summary models.

- [#691](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/691) [`9737eac`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9737eac67c2663031af0e9c78a78955cd7de6db0) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Account for runtime prompt overhead when threshold compaction is triggered from an observed token count. Lossless now compares Codex's live prompt count against its persisted context count and compacts far enough to cover the observed gap instead of clearing threshold debt while the live prompt may still be over target.

- [#659](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/659) [`2f07cfb`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/2f07cfb00c07fbfed756e1462d0de58ff97162a9) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Recover bounded transcript epochs when OpenClaw rewrites a session JSONL in place and the stored bootstrap checkpoint points past the new file end. LCM now treats same-path transcript shrink as an epoch rollover instead of accepting an empty append-only read as fully covered.

- [#651](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/651) [`bc66b3e`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/bc66b3e0992e3342507f6064466d3eeeb3bda2fe) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Recover stale session token totals after gateway restart without replacing already-fresh runtime totals.

- [#691](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/691) [`9737eac`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9737eac67c2663031af0e9c78a78955cd7de6db0) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Fix leaf compaction, TUI previews, and TUI rewrite sources for structured message-part rows whose stored message content is empty.

- [#628](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/628) [`13780e9`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/13780e9abce22a2c0b47dba9447d1d867e55ef52) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Fix v4.2 stub-tier drilldown fallback for migrated tool payloads, align the migration script's default storage directory with runtime state-dir config, and repair `--revert --dry-run`.

- [#681](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/681) [`554b8c6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/554b8c6a3b3a1653f4202ffa6fbdf6ef35f72d79) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Switch automatic compaction to threshold-triggered full sweeps and retire cache-aware incremental scheduling while keeping the existing 20k default leaf chunk size. Adds `sweepMaxDepth` as the preferred depth knob, keeps `incrementalMaxDepth` as a deprecated alias, and adds `summaryPrefixTargetTokens` so pressure sweeps can condense deeper when summarized context remains too large.

- [#649](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/649) [`84ed96e`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/84ed96e8b600bfc987fffb82397b70f06b2a49ac) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Preserve continuity when OpenClaw switches to a new transcript file for an existing session key. LCM now treats a bounded, path-mismatched transcript with no old anchor as a new transcript epoch, imports its recoverable messages, and avoids advancing checkpoints for no-anchor reads that imported nothing.

- [#652](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/652) [`93f9336`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/93f9336a681849399a6cc19917d97730f9e4ca01) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Repair delayed tool-result pairing when display-only assistant progress turns appear between the original assistant tool call and its result, and avoid replay-guard false positives while bootstrapping legitimate repeated transcript messages.

### Patch Changes

- [#591](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/591) [`f9a5164`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f9a5164c82f0973a0474396f77a06b210d129f79) Thanks [@coolmanns](https://github.com/coolmanns)! - Fail closed when oversized afterTurn dedup batches have no overlap with the stored LCM tail, preventing short stale runtime snapshots from being imported as fresh duplicate rows.

- [#592](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/592) [`e0dbd09`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/e0dbd097bf7ab3116a258b9a13153bd2d682e44f) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Automatically rotate oversized LCM-managed session JSONL files by default, with backup-backed rotation, active-session guardrails, startup scans limited to indexed OpenClaw session stores, one startup batch backup, and structured `[lcm] auto-rotate:` summary/detail logs for frequency and byte-savings telemetry.

- [#572](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/572) [`1b9ba0c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/1b9ba0ca1b6cea0d87031e7772fbf1a4225f8978) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Fix v0.9.3 regressions affecting prefill safety and provider routing:

  - Restore the reference-inequality contract on the no-user-turn assemble fallback. PR [#502](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/502)'s guard returned `params.messages` by reference, defeating the `installContextEngineLoopHook` `assembled.messages !== sourceMessages` check installed by PR [#504](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/504); the guard now uses the same `safeFallback()` helper as the other fallback paths so the gateway treats the result as assembled context.
  - Strip assistant messages whose only blocks are blank text (`[{type:"text", text:""}]`) during assembly, complementing the existing thinking-only filter so Bedrock no longer rejects with `The text field in the ContentBlock object at messages.N.content.0 is blank`.
  - Stop redirecting paid OpenAI API-key Codex users from `https://api.openai.com/v1` to `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`. `shouldUseNativeCodexBaseUrl` now respects an explicitly-configured baseUrl; the rewrite still applies when baseUrl is empty or already a ChatGPT Codex variant.
  - Remove the silent `http://localhost:11434` ollama fallback in `inferBaseUrlFromProvider` so cloud-only ollama configs (`https://ollama.com`) and self-hosted setups must be explicit; the prior default would silently route cloud configs to localhost.

- [#574](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/574) [`f986c29`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f986c29ca961e9d878a897e42d5f187ced182bd9) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Tighten packaging guards to prevent the silent-load failure mode [#555](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/555) fixed:

  - Add `test/manifest.test.ts` that asserts `openclaw.plugin.json#contracts.tools` matches the canonical `name:` fields exported by `src/tools/lcm-*-tool.ts` (discovered dynamically via directory scan, no hard-coded list) and the `registerTool` call sites in `src/plugin/index.ts` (matcher tolerates both arrow-expression and arrow-block bodies). Catches drift the next time a tool is added or renamed without a manifest update.
  - Tighten `peerDependencies` for `@mariozechner/pi-*` from `*` to `>=0.66 <1`, and `openclaw` from `*` to `>=2026.2.17 <2026.6.0`, so the next major silently mismatches at install-time rather than at runtime.
  - Add an upper bound (`<2026.6.0`) and a `tested: ["2026.5.2"]` array to `package.json#openclaw.compat`, so `openclaw plugins doctor` can flag known-incompatible host versions.
  - Add a CI smoke job that builds the bundle, installs `openclaw@latest` alongside, and verifies the bundle still imports cleanly with a callable `register` export. (A deeper smoke that drives `plugin.register(...)` against a stub api turned out to require more host-runtime fixture than is reasonable to maintain in CI; the deeper "register against the real openclaw plugin loader" check is followup work — see [#555](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/555) for the regression class that would warrant it.)
  - The Windows installer's hook-pack detector ([#451](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/451)) already saw `kind: "context-engine"` in the manifest; this is now covered by an explicit assertion in the manifest drift test.

  Closes [#570](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/570).

- [#576](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/576) [`9f55419`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9f554194fe04f6e002da3aeab611e893fa92a790) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Harden the afterTurn-lane robustness:

  - `scheduleDeferredCompactionDebtDrain` no longer silently skips when `compactionTelemetry` lacks provider/model — CLI-backend sessions ([#472](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/472)) accumulated debt forever. Now drains anyway when telemetry is missing (let the inner cache-aware gate decide), keeping silent debt off the floor. The visibility log is deduped to once per conversation per process so long-running CLI sessions don't spam every afterTurn.
  - `messageContentCoveredBySummary` (PR [#551](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/551)) replaces bare substring match with anchored-or-quoted matching — a 24+ char user instruction coincidentally appearing inside a long narrative summary is no longer silently dropped. The quote-span scan is also more resilient: an unmatched opening quote skips past instead of aborting the entire scan, so later well-formed quoted spans still get checked.
  - `reconcileTranscriptTailForAfterTurn` (PR [#551](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/551)) slow path no longer blindly re-reads the full session file when checkpoint is missing or path mismatched — refresh checkpoint and switch to incremental reads, with a one-shot warn for visibility. The dedupe set is bounded with FIFO eviction at 4096 entries so hosts churning through many sessions don't accumulate it indefinitely. The empty-`historicalMessages` branch now distinguishes "actually empty file" (size 0 → refresh checkpoint) from "non-empty file but parser failure" (size > 0 → emit warn, skip checkpoint refresh, keep the next afterTurn eligible to retry).

### Patch Changes

- [#557](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/557) [`5a6b11b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5a6b11b0a1e1f37a2f095731ed0decad74a70847) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Honor `cacheAwareCompaction.enabled: false` at the deferred-compaction dispatch gate, and add a critical-pressure escape so deferred compaction fires regardless of prompt-cache state when `currentTokenCount >= criticalBudgetPressureRatio * tokenBudget` (default 0.70). Previously, mutation-sensitive providers (Anthropic, Codex, Copilot) could livelock the dispatcher in high-velocity sessions: each turn refreshed `lastCacheTouchAt`, the cache TTL never expired, deferred work never fired, and the runtime emergency overflow handler was left to do all the work. The new escape preserves cache-aware throttling in the 0–70% headroom band while ensuring compaction always fires before overflow.

- [#470](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/470) [`8d634cd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/8d634cdf4b7544c9093c2e701fbbe5075d1e3de6) Thanks [@GodsBoy](https://github.com/GodsBoy)! - Document `lcm-tui` Codex OAuth flows with the explicit `openai-codex` provider so repair, rewrite, doctor, and backfill examples match the new Codex CLI delegate path after `codex login`.

- [#535](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/535) [`c8c185b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/c8c185bb68f768db584c34abfb55b2b578b1b902) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Treat Codex prompt-cache writes and recent cache touches as mutation-sensitive so deferred compaction does not rewrite hot cached prompts before the cache TTL expires.

- [#549](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/549) [`d8a7389`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d8a73890933f2992dc997b0dea6a1e193e364d37) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Fix `openai-codex` summarization for modern Codex model ids that are not present in the local `pi-ai` model catalog.

  Lossless now resolves native Codex transport defaults for these models and treats explicit provider error responses as provider failures, allowing configured fallback models to run instead of retrying as an empty summary and falling back to truncation.

- [#513](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/513) [`4724d3f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4724d3fe6ccfd85f275aad732f3b01551d909e5a) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Correct `lcm_expand_query` source-token accounting guidance for explicit leaf summaries.

- [#555](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/555) [`4ea5a99`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4ea5a99769238143e4a62c3b8797ffd56dd666c0) Thanks [@jeremyheslop](https://github.com/jeremyheslop)! - Declare `contracts.tools` in `openclaw.plugin.json` so OpenClaw 2026.5.2's stricter loader accepts the plugin's `lcm_grep`, `lcm_describe`, `lcm_expand`, and `lcm_expand_query` registrations. Without this declaration the loader emits `plugin must declare contracts.tools before registering agent tools` and the plugin fails to register, which silently disables compaction (the engine still loads but no tools are wired up).

- [#546](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/546) [`a4f7059`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/a4f7059a6e50f75e916f688070d2172043627464) Thanks [@baghvn](https://github.com/baghvn)! - Resolve uncataloged DeepSeek and other known provider models to their expected API family and base URL defaults when OpenClaw model metadata is unavailable.

- [#504](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/504) [`7063a1f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/7063a1f17b7be4cd60fc87563d5dbf9ce125b1c4) Thanks [@EpaL](https://github.com/EpaL)! - Prevent assistant-prefill failures on assemble fallback paths while preserving valid assembled assistant turns.

- [#502](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/502) [`74004a4`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/74004a4ef486ba2e351a4143acfb8cb4a7573b6c) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Fix prefill errors on cold-cache new sessions that start with only an assistant greeting.

  When a session begins with an agent greeting before any user message and the Anthropic
  prompt cache goes cold (>5 min), `assemble()` could return a context containing only
  the assistant greeting with no user turns. Providers that require conversations to end
  with a user message would then reject the LLM call, silently dropping the user's first
  real message.

  `assemble()` now detects when the assembled context contains no user-role messages at
  all (raw-message-only DB state where every stored message is `assistant` or `toolResult`)
  and falls back to the live context, which correctly ends with the user's current message.
  Sessions with compaction summaries are unaffected because summaries are always stored
  with `role: "user"`.

- [#501](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/501) [`ab22632`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ab2263215877c59738ce3e6d7608274147290aa7) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Move `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, and `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` from `dependencies` to optional `peerDependencies` so the plugin always resolves them from the host OpenClaw runtime instead of a pinned local copy.

  Previously these packages were pinned as `dependencies` (fixed at `0.66.1`), which caused npm to install a snapshot in the plugin's own `node_modules/`. That snapshot's internal path references (e.g. `provider.runtime-BlZSfz5M.js`) became stale whenever OpenClaw shipped a new build that bumped `pi-*`, breaking plugin registration on `openclaw ≥ 2026.4.20`.

  By declaring them as optional peer dependencies:

  - No local copy is installed (npm v7+ skips optional peer deps when they are not required by the consumer), so the host-provided versions are resolved via normal Node.js module lookup.
  - The build already marks `@mariozechner/*` as external (`--external:"@mariozechner/*"`), so the runtime was always intended to supply these modules.
  - `devDependencies` retains the pinned `0.66.1` versions so local builds and tests continue to work without needing a live OpenClaw installation.

- [#551](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/551) [`acb5643`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/acb5643a4ebd09af3626db1e3f2ce22133314ffd) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Skip afterTurn messages whose content is already covered by an auto-compaction summary, preventing safeguard-mode summary re-injection from duplicating user instructions in LCM context.

- [#482](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/482) [`8d6c0a1`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/8d6c0a1202b3079d718c47234c65b56b764abefa) Thanks [@banna-commits](https://github.com/banna-commits)! - Fix LCM migration recovery when existing databases are missing the `message_parts` table.

- [#511](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/511) [`eb59416`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/eb594167366366a9883c49b3cd30bec354da3f94) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Externalize oversized raw message payloads into large file records after existing file, image, and tool-result interceptors run.

- [#515](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/515) [`1c7b13f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/1c7b13fcdacace9a9446d357c360fb9d4313c952) Thanks [@SweetSophia](https://github.com/SweetSophia)! - Use runtime prompt token counts for after-turn compaction decisions when OpenClaw provides usage data, falling back to transcript estimates only when runtime counts are unavailable.

- [#507](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/507) [`f2574ed`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f2574ed9585ebba46b3574d9d2541444766cab19) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Drain deferred compaction debt only after foreground after-turn maintenance finishes so background work cannot race bootstrap refreshes or hot prompt-cache paths.

- [#503](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/503) [`fd62205`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/fd6220563a3629f19d6e1b6ee2ca490566bc2a57) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Strip provider reasoning and thinking blocks from leaf compaction summarizer input while preserving visible message text.

- [#455](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/455) [`370b91b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/370b91b58033a890f5ff9e97fd2a950a50618ba4) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Wrap SQLite migrations in a single exclusive transaction so concurrent startup agents serialize migration work instead of racing on per-statement autocommit writes.

- [#418](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/418) [`f8fe367`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f8fe367c9c7d18c0d2b470c72f799e516150c8aa) Thanks [@gitchrisqueen](https://github.com/gitchrisqueen)! - Fix manual and threshold-triggered compaction results so a full sweep that ends under the target budget reports `already under target` instead of a misleading no-op failure.

- [#433](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/433) [`5c8ef34`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5c8ef34ff6baf551a42c73dc1b217a3bb4828891) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Apply content-recency sorting consistently to CJK summary full-text search so recent summarized content does not lose to older but stronger trigram matches.

- [#355](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/355) [`6e9388c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/6e9388c17036caa6021ab075e4d91ee928d73986) Thanks [@LanicBlue](https://github.com/LanicBlue)! - Externalize inline base64 images before large tool-result text compaction, and add `largeFilesDir` / `LCM_LARGE_FILES_DIR` so externalized payload storage can be configured explicitly.

- [#403](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/403) [`ea7d532`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ea7d5327d648790350724c15990b5c1ab98bf611) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Convert bootstrap's file I/O off the Node.js event loop. `readFileSegment` and `readLastJsonlEntryBeforeOffset` previously used sync `openSync`/`readSync`/`statSync`, which could block the gateway for minutes while scanning multi-MB JSONL transcripts during the bootstrap append-only path. The bootstrap entry `statSync` and `refreshBootstrapState` helper are now async as well. The backward-scan loop now only reads new chunks when the current carry has no more newlines, and the fast path short-circuits before the backward scan when the DB's latest hash no longer matches the checkpoint (the common case during active sessions, where the scan can never succeed).

- [#395](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/395) [`2c05599`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/2c05599c7ac6977be47b3358589c8a43332b2d23) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Add `/lcm backup` and `/lcm rotate` plugin commands so users can snapshot the SQLite database on demand and split oversized active LCM conversations without changing their live OpenClaw session identity. Rotation now checkpoints the current transcript frontier so the fresh row starts from now forward instead of replaying older transcript history.

- [#425](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/425) [`3faa9bd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/3faa9bdb04c5fc01833a2b64a478f224254793a0) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Report the canonical `lossless-claw` context-engine id from the runtime engine metadata so newer OpenClaw builds accept the plugin's registered engine slot.

- [#420](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/420) [`e0fa375`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/e0fa375ae6fcd5964dae56cadf368e1718649128) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Fix `/lcm rotate` so it waits for the live database connection to become idle, takes a faithful pre-rotate backup on that connection, and then compacts the current session transcript without replacing the active LCM conversation. Rotation now preserves the existing conversation id, summaries, and context items while refreshing bootstrap state so dropped transcript history is not replayed.

- [#415](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/415) [`7668717`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/7668717ba3790c208baa8bcb9c4f2ae4f35d7910) Thanks [@ryanngit](https://github.com/ryanngit)! - Handle conversation creation races on active session keys without crashing the caller.

- [#223](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/223) [`028f171`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/028f17182350c120bf94f81781be3c9fbf11b206) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Expose `leafChunkTokens` as a first-class plugin config option so deployments can tune leaf compaction frequency without patching the plugin manifest.

- [#220](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/220) [`8f84d8e`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/8f84d8ebfbe2163e6624fffa7468ef0de928a9da) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Improve LongMemEval compaction and retrieval reliability by filtering reasoning text from summaries, retrying truncated summaries, hardening delegated expansion, and falling back to raw-message search in shallow trees.

- [#205](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/205) [`ef4865f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ef4865fb13a1a8e373a045c0dd2a907ae1bbbfde) Thanks [@aquaright1](https://github.com/aquaright1)! - Preserve assistant text and matched tool calls when pruning stale orphaned tool calls from assembled context.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- [#185](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/185) [`ec74779`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ec747792c01153e44f08bfbf410ddf2526fca7cf) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Fix `lcm-tui doctor` to detect third truncation marker format (`[LCM fallback summary; truncated for context management]`) and harden Claude CLI summarization with `--system-prompt` flag and neutral working directory to prevent workspace contamination.

- [#186](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/186) [`c796f7d`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/c796f7d9d014a19f2b55e62895a32327b0347694) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Harden LCM summarization so provider auth failures no longer persist fallback summaries, and stop forcing explicit temperature overrides on summarizer requests.

- [#182](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/182) [`954a2fd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/954a2fd848b6444561e26afc2b41ad01e27d5a08) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Improve `lcm-tui` session browsing by showing stable session keys in the session list and conversation header, and align the session list columns so message counts and LCM metadata are easier to scan.

- [#128](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/128) [`0f1a5d8`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/0f1a5d89a95225baee39e017449e5956e7990b27) Thanks [@TSHOGX](https://github.com/TSHOGX)! - Honor custom API base URL overrides for `lcm-tui rewrite`, `lcm-tui backfill`, and interactive rewrite so TUI summarization can use configured provider proxies and non-default endpoints.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- [#159](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/159) [`20b6c1b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/20b6c1bd0c8c5903ce4498e9cef235392fa0cfc4) Thanks [@tmchow](https://github.com/tmchow)! - Fix legacy tool-call backfill for rows that stored ids under `metadata.raw.call_id`.

- [#163](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/163) [`31307a6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/31307a671549438fe795b1ddd941a9af90ec51dc) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Prevent the summarizer from reusing the active session auth profile when an explicit LCM summary provider and model are configured.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#157](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/157) [`f3f0aa2`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f3f0aa29e636542e47f5020a1d6759dff023d798) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Add `lcm-tui doctor` command for auto-detecting and repairing truncation-fallback summaries. Features position-aware marker detection (rejects false positives from summaries that quote markers in narrative text), bottom-up repair ordering, OAuth/token CLI delegation, and transaction-safe dry-run mode.

- [#138](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/138) [`9047e49`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9047e49a91db0e4cba83f4f1c11fc10a899e5528) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Add incremental bootstrap checkpoints and large tool-output externalization.

  This release speeds up restart/bootstrap by checkpointing session transcript state,
  skipping unchanged transcript replays, and using append-only tail imports when a
  session file only grew. It also externalizes oversized tool outputs into
  `large_files` with compact placeholders so long-running OpenClaw sessions keep
  their full recall surface without carrying giant inline tool payloads in the
  active transcript.

### Patch Changes

- [#156](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/156) [`968b1d6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/968b1d6b2ff41a297645309aa7c1d7dc80bee7ab) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Fix compaction auth failures: surface provider auth errors instead of silently aborting, fall back to deterministic truncation when summarizer returns empty content, fall through to legacy auth-profiles.json when modelAuth returns scope-limited credentials. TUI now sets WAL mode and busy_timeout to prevent SQLITE_BUSY during concurrent usage.

- [#129](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/129) [`133665c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/133665c24d5e4bdd1ad01cd4373b65af5d37d868) Thanks [@semiok](https://github.com/semiok)! - Use LIKE search for full-text queries containing CJK characters. SQLite FTS5's `unicode61` tokenizer can return empty or incomplete results for Chinese/Japanese/Korean text, so CJK queries now bypass FTS and use the existing LIKE-based fallback for correct matches.

- [#132](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/132) [`4522a72`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4522a7217511dc99be2576ac49cb216515213aea) Thanks [@hhe48203-ctrl](https://github.com/hhe48203-ctrl)! - Persist the resolved compaction summarization model on summary records instead of
  always showing `unknown`.

  Existing `summaries` rows keep the `unknown` fallback through an additive
  migration, while newly created summaries now record the actual model configured
  for compaction.

- [#126](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/126) [`437c240`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/437c240c580e0407f4732b401792bec10ab50f1b) Thanks [@cryptomaltese](https://github.com/cryptomaltese)! - Annotate attachment-only messages during compaction without dropping short captions.

  This release improves media-aware compaction summaries by replacing raw
  `MEDIA:/...` placeholders for attachment-only messages while still preserving
  real caption text, including short captions such as `Look at this!`, when a
  message also includes a media attachment.

- [#146](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/146) [`c37777f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/c37777f416afb088f816fe1bb10b17773d08306f) Thanks [@qualiobra](https://github.com/qualiobra)! - Fix a session-queue cleanup race that could leak per-session queue entries during
  overlapping ingest or compaction operations.

- [#131](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/131) [`bab46cc`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/bab46ccd633ee159443b965793cb83cb64f673a2) Thanks [@semiok](https://github.com/semiok)! - Add 60-second timeout protection to summarizer LLM calls. Previously, a slow or unresponsive model provider could block the `deps.complete()` call indefinitely, starving the Node.js event loop and causing downstream failures such as Telegram polling disconnects. Both the initial and retry summarization calls are now wrapped with a timeout that rejects cleanly and falls through to the existing deterministic fallback.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 45f714c: Add `expansionModel` and `expansionProvider` overrides for delegated
  `lcm_expand_query` subagent runs.
- 1e6812a: Add session scoping controls for ignored and stateless OpenClaw sessions,
  including cron and subagent pattern support, and make runtime summary model
  environment overrides win reliably over plugin config during compaction.

### Patch Changes

- 518a1b2: Restore automatic post-turn compaction when OpenClaw omits the top-level
  `tokenBudget`, by resolving fallback budget inputs consistently before using
  the default compaction budget.
- 6c54c7b: Declare explicit OpenClaw tool names for the LCM factory-registered tools so
  plugin metadata and tool listings stay populated in hosts that require
  `registerTool(..., { name })` hints for factory registrations.
- 9ee103a: Fix condensed summary expansion so replay walks the source summaries that were compacted into a node, and skip proactive compaction when turn ingest fails to avoid compacting a stale frontier.
- ae260f7: Fix the TUI Anthropic OAuth fallback so Claude CLI summaries respect the selected model and stay within the expected summary size budget.
- 8f77fe7: Run LCM migrations during engine startup and only advertise `ownsCompaction`
  when the database schema is operational, while preserving runtime compaction
  settings and accurate token accounting for structured tool results.
- 7fae41c: Fix assembler round-tripping for tool results so structured `tool_result` content is preserved and normalized tool metadata no longer inflates context token budgeting.
- ceee14e: Restore stable conversation continuity across OpenClaw session UUID recycling
  by resolving sessions through `sessionKey` for both writes and read-only
  lookups, and keep compaction/ingest serialization aligned with that stable
  identity.
- bbd2ecb: Emit LCM startup and configuration banner logs only once per process so
  repeated OpenClaw plugin registration during snapshot loads does not duplicate
  the same startup lines.
- 82becaf: Remove hardcoded non-LCM recall tool names from the dynamic summary prompt so
  agents rely on whatever memory tooling is actually available in the host
  session.
- 6b85751: Restore compatibility for existing OpenClaw sessions that still reference the
  legacy `default` context engine, and improve container deployments by adding a
  supported Docker image and startup flow for LCM-backed OpenClaw environments.
- 828d106: Improve LCM summarization model resolution so configured `summaryModel`
  overrides, OpenClaw `agents.defaults.compaction.model`, and newer
  `runtimeContext` inputs are honored more reliably while preserving
  compatibility with older `legacyCompactionParams` integrations.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f1dfa5c: Catch up the release notes for work merged after `0.2.8`.

  This release adds Anthropic OAuth setup-token support in the TUI, resolves
  SecretRef-backed auth-profile credentials and provider-level custom provider
  configuration during summarization, and formats LCM tool timestamps in the local
  timezone instead of UTC.
